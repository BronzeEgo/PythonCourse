URLList
    This will change often and will use the feed feature...The feed will need to be automatically shuffled by a seperate script

What it will get
    ProdName
    Price
    StockStatus
    ...

Things to make it look human
    move mouse
    stay on some pages longer
    shuffle url list(see above)
    go to random pages but don't scrap anything
        I will have a list of random pages for the program to select from, maybe all of them from sitemap
    have it occasionally follow a link rather than just typing URL
        maybe create a program that looks at the links on a page and follows them half the time of they match the standard URLList
            it would need to know not to follow links that have already been followed(including those on list)
    ...

I could probably add more here as needed and repurpose this for each site eventually...
