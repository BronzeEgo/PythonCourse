# The built in function is 'input'

# For this one, everything is on the same line
name = input("Enter your name here: ")
print("You said " + name)

# For this one, the input is on a separate line, maybe making readability and use easier...
print("Enter your name here: ")
name = input()
print("You said " + name)
