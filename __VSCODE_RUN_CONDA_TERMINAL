1) Open a new terminal
2) & cmd /k "activate testpack & powershell"
    NOTE: 'testpack' is the env at the time of writing this
        that will change depending on the env you want to use
    ANOTHER NOTE: The first time I did this (vscode did it for me), 
        the name of the terminal changed to 'Python' (with capital P)
        I'm guessing this has to do with the '& powershell' above
        I haven't noticed a difference yet in output, but I'm sure there 
        is one!

        If I do '& Python' (capital or lowercase 'p')
        the terminal name changes to python 'lowercase p'
3)That's it I think. Just make sure you are in correct dir for what you want to run...


Another (easier to remember) way of doing this is Ctrl+Shift+P and Python: Create terminal
This automatically does the stuff above and the term is called 'Python' (with capital 'p')
