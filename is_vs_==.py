#No code, just a quick look

#What is the difference between 'is' and '=='

#In python, '==' and 'is' are very similar\
#a=1
#a ==1 IS True
#a is 1 IS True

#a = [1,2,3]
#b = [1,2,3]
#a == b IS True
#a is b IS FALSE (LOOK AT THIS ONE AGAIN)

#c = b
#b is c IS TURE (LOOK AT THIS ONE AGAIN)

#is is only truthy if the variables reference the same item in memory
