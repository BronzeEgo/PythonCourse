# This is about what style to use for Python.
# Since Python is so strict, there is only one standard.
# The PEP 8 style guide.
# I don't have the link here, but I'm sure it is in lecture 95 (or 96)
# as will as easily found using google.

# Using VSCode makes the styling happen automatically...
# maybe...

# auto pep 8 is the tool that Colt uses.

# autopep8 --in-place script.py
# is the command line code he used.

# see section 22, lecture 222 for autopep8 details
# I don't need to know the format, it will do it for me.
# conda is a bit different than described, but with vscode, installation and use is super easy.
# just make use 'automatically format on save' is checked in settings
