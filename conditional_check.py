#this is a first attempt at conditional logic. I already did this, but figured I'd make a simple program for future reference.


print("What is your name?")
name = input()

if name == "Arya Stark":
    print("Valar Morghulis")
elif name == "Jon Snow":
    print("You know nothing")
else:
    print("Carry on")
